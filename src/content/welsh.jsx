                maximum word count for prose is 3000 and 40 lines for Poetry. For audio and video, we will need a transcript that fits within the word/line count. For more experimental sounds and videos, from wind to rain, let your creativity shine; the limit is 3 minutes.

              As we are writing about North Wales, our anthology will be bilingual, accepting both Welsh and English submissions! We also strongly encourage unpublished writers to give it a try; weâ€™d love to help your voices be heard!
